  a lot as you can see it is bleeding a lot  Hi, I have a broken foot because my bone hurts.
  yeah my front right tooth hurts a lot let me give you some floss for that you want to give me floss yeah we can worry about your
  broken foot later. I think it will possibly heal itself due to later late the latest literature does show that if you leave your foot broken foot alone it will naturally heal itself.
